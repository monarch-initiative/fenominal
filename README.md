# set up
The release version of the library should be compatible with Java 11 and newer. We will release the GUI as a standalone
app and are building it with Java 16. To install Java 16 on an ubuntu system, follow these steps

```bazaar
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linuxuprising/java
sudo apt update
sudo apt install oracle-java16-installer # ( --no-install-recommends would not install Java16 as the default)
# if desired -- sudo apt-get remove oracle-java16-installer (de-install)
(notes)
update-alternatives: using /usr/lib/jvm/java-16-oracle/bin/jpackage to provide /
usr/bin/jpackage (jpackage) in auto mode
Oracle JDK 16 installed
#####Important########
To set Oracle JDK 16 as default, install the "oracle-java16-set-default" package
E.g.: sudo apt install oracle-java16-set-default.
```
