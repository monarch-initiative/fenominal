fenominal: Phenomenal text mining for disease and phenotype concepts
====================================================================


fenominal
~~~~~~~~~

Fenominal is a Java 17 application for text-mining
`Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) <http://www.human-phenotype-ontology.org>`_ terms from text. Fenominal is
a multimodule project with a ``core`` module with the text-mining logic and a ``cli`` module for use from the
command line. A graphical user interface (GUI) is available in a separate project
called `Fenominal-GUI <https://github.com/monarch-initiative/fenominal-gui>`_.

Fenominal does not rely on external APIs and can be used in settings in which a firewall does not permit applications
to access the internet.  Fenominal is intended for use as a software library and the CLI module only
contains simple demo applications.
