fenominal: Phenomenal text mining for disease and phenotype concepts
====================================================================


fenominal
~~~~~~~~~

Fenominal is a Java 16 application for text-mining
`Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) <http://www.human-phenotype-ontology.org>`_ terms from text. Fenominal is
a multimodule project with a ``core`` module with the text-mining logic, a ``cli`` module for use from the
command line, and a ``gui`` module to provide a Graphical User Interface.

Fenominal does not rely on external APIs and can be used in settings in which a firewall does not permit applications
to access the internet.
